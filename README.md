### Grids & Patterns
- How did your initial paper sketches influence your digital pattern? Did anything change in translation?
- What strategies did you use to balance order and randomness in your grid or pattern?
- Describe a moment when a mistake or unexpected result led to a new idea or direction.
- How did you approach making your pattern “infinite” or seamlessly tileable? What challenges did you face?
- How did working with code change your perception of artistic control compared to analog methods?
- What did you learn about the relationship between simple rules and complex outcomes?
