### Introduction & Foundations

- How did analog rules compare to coding rules?
  
> analogue rules: Done physicaly by hand therfore it's imperfect but organic, it's time consuming, not really flexibal (Hard to change once started), when there is randomness it's mostly by acident, it has texture and "personality" because the rules lived in the artist hands

- Where did ambiguity or randomness lead to surprising results?
- Which historical examples inspired you?
- What was difficult about setting up your environment?

### Grids & Patterns

- How did your initial paper sketches influence your digital pattern? Did anything change in translation?
- What strategies did you use to balance order and randomness in your grid or pattern?
- Describe a moment when a mistake or unexpected result led to a new idea or direction.
- How did you approach making your pattern “infinite” or seamlessly tileable? What challenges did you face?
- How did working with code change your perception of artistic control compared to analog methods?
- What did you learn about the relationship between simple rules and complex outcomes?
